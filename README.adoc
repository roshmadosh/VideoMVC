= Java MVC Done Many Ways

Deplying an MVC web app as "manually" as possible. +

Started by generating a creating a simple servlet, packaging it into a 
WAR file with Gradle, then copying it into the ``webapp`` directory on 
a locally running Tomcat server. +

IMPORTANT: `@EnableWebMvc` is a required annotation for your configuration class if you 
want object-mapping on your controllers.  

The config classes are where you set `@ComponentScan` so you don't have to register the 
beans yourself. Every context has it's own config file, i.e. it's own set of beans. 
You can distinguish shared _root_ contexts from isolated _servlet_, or app-level contexts.
